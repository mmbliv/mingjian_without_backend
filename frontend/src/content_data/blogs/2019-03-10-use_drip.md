# Update (June 10, 2019)

We have implemented DRIP as a LAMMPS built-in model, and it is available since
the `5Jun19` version. Note
- It is in the `USER-MISC` package, so you need to add it when installing LAMMPS
- Examples at `lammps/examples/USER/misc/drip/` or you can find it
  [here](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/tree/master/examples/USER/misc/drip)
- Google `lammps pair drip` to get documentation

# Original post (March 10, 2019)

The `DRIP (Dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent interlayer potential)`
provides an improved description of the interlayer interactions for multilayer
graphene structures.
See [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.98.235404) for more information
about it. We have implemented the `DRIP` as a KIM model.
To use it, follow the below instructions.

## KIM-API
Follow <https://openkim.org/kim-api/> to install `kim-api-v2-2.0.0`.

The instructions given there assume you have root access and install the API to
`/usr/local`.
If you do not have root access or want to install to another directory, follow
`INSTALL` in the `kim-api-v2-2.0.0` package.

Note, if you chose not to install the `kim-api-v2-2.0.0` package in the standard
location, you will need to get the kim-api library on `PATH` by doing some thing
like (assume you are using `Bash`):
```bash
$ source activate path/to/the/installed/kim-api/library/bin/kim-api-v2-activate
```

## DRIP driver and model
The `DRIP` driver and model can be obtained from my [GitHub](https://github.com/mjwen).
The "v2.0.0" branch of both the driver and model is compatible with `kim-api-v2-2.0.0`.
Below is a quick way to install them.

### install the driver
```bash
$ git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/mjwen/DRIP_WenTadmor__MD_000000111111_000.git
$ kim-api-v2-collections-management install user ./DRIP_WenTadmor__MD_000000111111_000
```

### install the model
```bash
$ git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/mjwen/DRIP_WenTadmor_2018_C__MO_000000111111_000.git
$ kim-api-v2-collections-management install user ./DRIP_WenTadmor_2018_C__MO_000000111111_000
```

To check that the driver and model are successfully installed, do:
```bash
$ kim-api-v2-collections-management list
```
You should be able to see
`DRIP_WenTadmor__MD_000000111111_000` and `DRIP_WenTadmor_2018_C__MO_000000111111_000`.
in the `User Collection`.


## LAMMPS (optional)

To use KIM with LAMMPS, you will need `pair_kim`.
For now please put [pair_kim.cpp](https://mjwen.github.io/files/pair_kim.cpp)
and [pair_kim.h](https://mjwen.github.io/files/pair_kim.h) into your LAMMPS
`src` directory (we have made pull request to LAMMPS and the next official
release of LAMMPS will be compatible with KIM), and then make LAMMPS the usual
way you do.

`pair_kim` now only supports `atom_style atomic`, so please use it in your
LAMMPS input script.
`DRIP` only provides the interlayer interactions, so if you want to use it
together with a potential that provides the intralayer interaction (`REBO` for
example), you can use the `hybrid/overlay` pair style and put in the LAMMPS
script the following lines:
```
pair_style   hybrid/overlay kim DRIP_WenTadmor_2018_C__MO_000000111111_000 rebo
pair_coeff   * * kim C
pair_coeff   * * rebo CH.airebo C
```

Note, we implement the `DRIP` potential in KIM using a different approach from
the `KC` potential in LAMMPS.
In the KIM implementation of `DRIP`, we have a method to separate the simulation
configuration into layers automatically.
So there is no need to assign atoms into different molecules as the LAMMPS `KC`
implementation.
