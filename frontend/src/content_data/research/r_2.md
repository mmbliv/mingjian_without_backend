title: Accelerated Atomistic Molecular Simulations
img: img/research_img/r_2.png
content: Molecular simulations are a powerful computational technique for exploring material behavior and properties based on an understanding of the physics of bonding at the atomic scale. At the core of any molecular simulation lies a description of the interactions between atoms that produces the forces governing the atomic motion. In classical molecular simulations, such interactions are modeled via interatomic potentials, which make it possible to simulate millions of atoms for nanoseconds.<br><br>We develop both physics-based and machine learning interatomic potentials and apply them to study the energetic, structural, thermal, and mechanical properties of next-generation materials for renewable energy applications. In addition, we also develop potential model analysis frameworks (e.g. uncertainty quantification methods), aiming at making classical molecular simulations more reliable, reproducible, and accessible.
