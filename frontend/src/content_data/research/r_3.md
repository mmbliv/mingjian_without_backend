Quantum chemical theory and computations are powerful tools for understanding and designing materials. Conventional approaches that manually perform the calculations are difficult to manage complex materials science workflows and difficult to fully utilize modern high-performance computing resources.<br><br>

Building on top of the software stack that powers the Materials Project, we develop high-throughput materials discovery recipes and apply them to search for materials with specific properties with applications in healthcare and catalysis. These workflows also underpin our infrastructure that produces high-quality first-principles data to develop machine learning models for chemical reactions and interatomic potentials.
